		North County Rally Team Story
	</h1>
	<p> 
		My name is Ty Crawford, and I am the driver behind car #314, the North County Rally Team Impreza. Our car is a 1995 Subaru Impreza Outback Sport wagon, competing in Rally America's Open Light class. The Show Me Rally on October 7th, 2017, will be our first stage rally race.

		<h3>
			THE RACE
		</h3>
		<p>
			Our first race will be the Show Me Rally located in Washington County, Missouri. Our team is headquartered in Florissant, Missouri, and we are very fortunate to have two annual stage rallies within driving distance of home here in Missouri, the other being the legendary Rally in the 100 Acre Wood, which now takes place in March. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Stage rally is a race against the clock, not necessarily against other racers. Stage rally is so named because each event consists of special stages, going from A to B, often on gravel and dirt public roads. Each car has a driver and a co-driver. The co-driver's job is to read pace notes to the driver many turns in advance so that the driver can visualize in his head the road ahead of him in order to maximize each turn. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			THE ENGINE
		</h3>
		<p>
			As per the rules laid out by Rally America, rookies such as myself are restricted to naturally aspriated engines. That is, those engines that do not use a turbo or supercharger. To compensate for this restriction, engines are built to maximize horsepower and torque given the restrictions of the class. Our engine displacement cannot exceed 2.65 liters. Most Subaru engines are between 1.8 and 2.5 liters, with many 2.2 liters on the market as a known reliable engine. We combine components from all three. We have built what is known as a "frankenmotor", which combines the cylinder block from a 2.5L Subaru engine with the cylinder heads from a 2.2L Subaru engine. This results in a high compression ratio, which should increase power. Ideally, we will see an increase in bottom end torque, a great improvement for stage rally racing where pulling out of corners is important. We also installed a 1.8L intake manifold, which really serves to benefit the simplicity of the installationm, since the car was originally equipped with that exact manifold.
		</p>
		<p>
			Running a high compression build really puts us in a position where we require a higher octane fuel. We're hoping that for the sake of competition, 93 octane will be sufficient. After the race, in the winter, we plan on rebuilding this engine to run even higher compression, and part of that will require going to a higher octane fuel, and ethanal E85 may be a suitable option. The rebuild will consist of replacing the pistons and rings, going to reground upgraded torque cams, replacing head gaskets, replacing the head bolts with head studs, and increasing the flow of the exhaust system, through removing the catalytic converters and installing a true equal length header. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The 1995 Impreza uses an engine computer to manage its fuel injection system, however its systems are quite primitive, as were most in 1995. The OBD-1 standard does not offer modern compatibility, live datalogging, or any useful diagnostics. We intend to replace the ECM with a unit called a Speeduino. The Speeduino is an Arduino based engine management platform that can be easily tuned and datalogged. We aim to install this unit as well as rig it to a custom digital dash display to provide critical data. The Speeduino platform natively supports GM Flex-Fuel sensors, which will allow the use of E85 fuel with ease. 
		</p>
		<h3>
			SAFETY EQUIPMENT
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Rally America rules also lay out very specific safety rules. Before any racer spends money on making a car faster, the racer should first make the car safe. The foundation of safety in our car is our 6 point roll cage. Made of 1.75" x 0.120" steel tubing, our cage meets and exceeds all standards laid out by the sanctioning body. We specifically went the extra mile to ensure that we weren't rolling into the race with minimum safety gear.

		<p>
			Along with the rollcage, our car is fitted with two FIA certified single piece race seats. To keep us in these seats are SFI certified 6 point race harnesses. Each of these harnesses mount to the chassis in size points, and strap us to the seats. At that point, only our appendages can move. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Many people will recall the passing of NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt, and many experts concluded that his death at the end of a race was caused by not using what is called a HANS device. More and more, HANS devices, or Head-And-Neck-Systems, have been required in motorsports. The HANS device straps the helmet to the body. This limits the amount of travel ones head and neck can experience in the event of a crash. Traditional HANS devices rely on the shoulder harnesses to strap the device to the body, however, newer units are being certified that strap to the body, regardless of the condition or position of the belts.
